# Note: we can't vendor containerd!
#
# vendoring containerd would result in "panic: http: multiple registrations for /debug/requests",
# because we would have both `github.com/containerd/containerd/...init()` and
# `github.com/AkihiroSuda/containerd-zfs/vendor/github.com/containerd/containerd/...init()`
